General Observations
1. Make CONSTANTS: ssid and password of the wifi, ip address, gateway, devices pin numbers, etc
2. Unclear what code does what, IPAddress is mixed with WebServer code
3. Make methods for what you are doing using expressive names so it is easier to debug
4. Change the Serial.print debugging either to print on the lcd or remove it altogether
5. Find better way to make the html String because it is impossible to debug or even change
6. Do away with the jQuery and all the libraries I imported, its just a simple page with 1 button do I need all this bloat?
7. You have almost no documentation and the code isn't self documenting, so creates a problem

Specific Changes Advised:
make time format method and call it separately, this code should not be in the refreshDisplay method
also bugs with current code
so simple to fix
if hour == 0 then hour = 12
if hour > 12 then hour -= 12
thats all I need

make a main loop
put all logic for the lcd into a method called display() and call this from the main loop
make a method call determineState() and call this from main loop


put all logic for checking the button presses into a method called checkButtonPress() and call from determineState()
put all logic for checking timer into a method called checkTimer() and call from determineState()
put all logic for the relay state into a method called determineRelayState() and call from determineState()
